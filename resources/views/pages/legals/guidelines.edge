      <h3>Content Contribution Guidelines</h3>

      <p>
        We want Adocasts to be a welcoming environment, therefore we want to ask our users to adhear to a few simple rules.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong class="block" style="margin-bottom: .5rem;">Be mindful of your username</strong>
          Your username isn't a place to attack, impersonate, or be vulgar. Please, keep your username PG.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="block" style="margin-bottom: .5rem;">Keep it a friendly PG</strong>
          Please refrain from posting, commenting, or sharing porn or other forms of adult content. Please
          don't curse, use offensive language, attack others, or attack yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="block" style="margin-bottom: .5rem;">Don't try to break Adocasts</strong>
          Please don't do anything with the intention of breaking our site. We like it here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="block" style="margin-bottom: .5rem;">Don't spam</strong>
          We ask that if you self-promote you also contribute to Adocasts in other ways too. Other means of spamming are frowned upon as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="block" style="margin-bottom: .5rem;">Cross-posting is welcomed</strong>
          If you post content on the Adocasts platform, you still own your content and are welcome to post it elsewhere as well.
